# Sensors, Noise, and Walking Analysis Project
## Project Description
This project aims to analyze users' gait and gather information about walking patterns using the accelerometers on smartphones. Inspired by Maria Yousefian's MSc thesis work on gait analysis, we will explore the use of smartphone sensors to determine walking pace, walking speed, gait asymmetry, and the impact of phone placement on the results. The project involves data collection, data analysis, and the application of various techniques such as data filtering, Fourier transform, and linear regression.

The report provides insights into the methodology used for data collection and processing. It presents the results of the analysis, including frequency analysis, classification using machine learning models, and linear regression. The conclusions highlight the accuracy of the classification scores for gender and the limitations of the linear regression model in predicting step frequency based on weight. The report also includes a project experience summary and references for further reading.

## Data Analysis

The data analysis process involves several steps, including data filtering, Fourier transform, and linear regression. The provided scripts in the repository handle these steps and produce visualizations and analysis results. You can modify the scripts or develop new ones to further analyze the data or apply different techniques.

## Limitations

It is important to note that the results obtained from the analysis may not be perfect due to the limitations of smartphone sensors and the presence of noise in the data. The accuracy and usefulness of the results depend on the quality of the data collected and the applied analysis techniques. Additionally, the linear regression model may not accurately predict step frequency based on weight, as indicated in the project report.
